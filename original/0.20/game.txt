@grenade_smoke_name=2x Smoke Grenade
@grenade_smoke_desc=The standard Army smoke grenade, creates a 5m wide smoke cloud, blocking view and creating confusion - while alerting enemies that something is amiss. Probably toxic in indoor spaces, but we don't model that in the game TBH.\n\nUse smoke to conceal your approach and get in a position of advantage. Note that smoke does NOT actually block gunfire.\n\nFuse time: Instant\nBurn time: 14s
@grenade_flashbang_name=2x Flashbang
@grenade_flashbang_kit_name=3x Flashbang
@grenade_flashbang_desc=The non-lethal flashbang grenade will stun, blind and deafen anyone within 3m of its detonation point, gaining you a few seconds of safety. It won't affect your troops, 'cause, well, we train them hard enough.\n\nUse Flashbangs to distract hostage guards and bad guys in vantage positions.\n\nFuse time: Instant\nEffective Range: 2m\nMax Range: 3.5m
@grenade_stinger_name=2x Stinger
@grenade_stinger_desc=A not-really-lethal grenade that explodes into a swarm of "harmless" rubber balls, stinging people and causing them to flee and take cover - if they can still walk, that is.\n\nUse Stingers to scare off civilians and troublemakers and clear your line of fire, but don't drop them on top of people you care about.\n\nFuse time: 1s\nEffective Range: 4m\nInjury Range: 1m
@grenade_frag_name=2x Frag Grenade
@grenade_frag_desc=The standard grenade you throw to blow people up. Will fill anyone caught within killing range with deadly metal FRAGments. Does not forgive, does not care. What could go wrong?\n\nUse Frags to take out enemies hidden in cover, but mind the non-combatants.\n\nFuse time: 1s\nKill Range: 2m\nInjury Range: 4m
@slap_charge_name=1x Slap Charge
@slap_charge_desc=A small self-adhesive explosive charge you slap on the door to blow the lock off. Will only create minimal splatter, so its safe for most situations.\n\nUse it to gain quick entry to locked rooms while keeping the element of surprise. Can also be used to clear windows for entry.\n\nPlacement time: 2.5s
@gear_torch_name=1x Thermal Torch
@gear_torch_desc=A self-contained, disposable torch that literally burns through padlocks, metal doors and chainlink fences alike.\n\nWill create a light-and-sound show for the benefit of the enemy, so use only when stealth is not important.\n\nUse time: 3s\n\n*not a lightsaber!
@slap_charge_kit_name=3x Slap Charge
@grenade_smoke_kit_name=3x Smoke Grenade
@grenade_frag_kit_name=3x Frag Grenade
@breaching_charge_name=1 x Wall Breach Charge

Watch out for potential danger to hostages and civilians.\n\nPlacement time: 6s\nKill Range: 4m\nInjury Range: 6m
@armor_rangers_basicvest_name=Standard Rangers Vest
@armor_rangers_basicvest_desc=Just the Modular Plate Carrier you were issued by the Regiment, what did you really expect? Flannel Daddy's gear closet?\n\nYou do get a pair of Level III plates to the front and back, and a bit of pistol caliber protection elsewhere.\n\nRemember -  trusting Armor is a game of chance, its your tactics that keep you alive!
@armor_rangers_levelIVaddon_name=Rangers Vest / ESAPI Plates
@armor_rangers_levelIVaddon_desc=Replace the Hard Armor plates in your vest with the slighlty heavier ESAPIs and thus gain Level IV protection - good versus Armor Piercing and Sniper threats.\n\nThe plates only cover your front and rear vital zones, and there's plenty of 'you' that stays uncovered by anything except good old ripstop fabric. 
@armor_rangers_levelIVsides_name=Rangers Vest / Full ESAPI
@armor_rangers_levelIVsides_desc=Mount ESAPI plates in all pockets of your vest, including front, rear and the large side inserts.\n\nYou'll lose some comfort and tactical mobility, but when the Armor Piercing threat is significant, you better buckle up.  
@armor_rangers_extended_name=Extended Rangers Vest
@armor_rangers_extended_desc=When the MRAP drops you at Tango's door, there's not much point in going light, but there's plenty of reasons to armor up as each door could lead to an enemy ambush!\n\nAdd side plates, groin, deltoids and collar protection to your vest, and leave mobility and fast flanking moves to your buddies.\n\nThe vest excels at stopping rifle shots from the front, but won't stop enemy sniper rounds or Armor Piercing ammo.
@armor_rangers_jumpable_name=Fast Raid Vest
@armor_rangers_jumpable_desc=When you got to move faster than the enemy reacts but you still want some rifle threat protection, a minimalistic Plate Carrier can be the way to go.\n\nA pair of standalone Level III plates protect your vitals from incoming Kalash fire but your flanks are completely unprotected.\n\nJust repeat 'keep in cover, move fast, shoot first, die last' till it becomes second nature, and hopefully you won't die at all. 
@armor_rangers_jump_swimmeriv_name=Fast Raid / Level IV Plates
@armor_rangers_jump_swimmeriv_desc=For discerning users, the Swimmer-cut multi-curve Level IV plates provide protection from Sniper-grade and Armor Piercing projectiles - without sacrificing much mobility, as they literally have their corners cut for improved weapons manipulation and overall comfort.\n\nThe Fast Raid platform still provides no side protection and only keeps your vitals covered, so if you have to get shot, better hope the enemy aims true and does not miss!
@armor_rangers_noplates_name=Rangers Vest / No Plates
@armor_rangers_noplates_desc=Take out the Hard Armor Plates in your vest, hoping that if you keep the soft armor backers the Sarge won't notice how much of an idiot you truly are.\n\nYou'll gain some mobility for sure but, remember, Nowheraki Insurgents shop at AKs-r-rUs and their rounds punch right through this vest.\n\nOld soldiers tell you the best armor is not being shot at all, so move fast and get off  the X and inside the enemy's OODA loop.
@armor_no_armour_name=No Armor
@armor_cia_tacvestIII_name=Tac Vest / Level III
@armor_cia_tacvestIII_desc=A high-end plate carrier with all-around level III protection, including front, back and underarm side plates.\n\nWill reliably stop incoming fire from your run-of-the-mill AK, but keep in mind the focus is on mobility, not invulnerability - even if your vitals are covered, you're still made of flesh.\n\nDon't even think about special threats, though - if sniper fire is coming, use suppression and mobility to stay alive. 
@armor_cia_tacvestIV_name=Tac Vest / Level IV
@armor_cia_tacvestIV_desc=When the going gets really tough but the mission still needs doing, all-around level IV protection might save the day.\n\nWill stop most special threats including the dreaded 7.62 Rimmed from the SVD sniper rifles and PK family machineguns, but don't let that fool you into a false sense of security. The vest stops under your neck, and the head is 'out there, in harm's way'.   
@armor_cia_concealableII_name=Soft Armor / Level II
@armor_cia_concealableII_desc=A thin concealable armor vest that should go unnoticed under most clothing styles, and let you get close to the enemy without raising suspicions too soon.\n\nIn this line of work, its best to not get shot at by anyone, but the vest does stop your average pistol and SMG round even point blank.\n\nRifles and full size SMGs like the Mp5A will pierce right through, however. 
@armor_cia_concealableIIIAlimited_name=Armor Panels / Level IIIA
@armor_cia_concealableIIIAlimited_desc=When going undercover, the distance between a succesfull infiltration and a deadly gunfight is sometimes measured in seconds. Gunfighter skills help to stay alive, but so does good planning and a bit of of armor.\n\nThis undershirt maximizes concealment while keepin a pair of level IIIA panels to the front and back of your torso, covering your vitals from pistol and SMG threats. 
@armor_cia_concealableIIIA_name=Soft Armor / Level IIIA
@armor_cia_concealableIIIA_desc=The thickest soft armor vest you can conceal and get away with it, it offers all-around protection against pistol caliber threats and keeps you too warm during those hot days out in the sunny Nowheraki countryside.
@armor_enemy_softarmor_name=Concealable Soft Armor
@armor_enemy_heavyarmor_name=Minimalistic Plate Carrier

@armor_no_armour_desc=<OLD!>Who needs armor when bearing a big shield?\n\nNo investment needed but you DO need to pull\nsome strings if you intend to go out naked.
@armor_low_thread_armor_name=Low Threat Armor
@armor_low_thread_armor_desc=<OLD!>Soft armor vest covering the officer's\nvital zones with all around Level IIIA\nprotection.\n\nWill reliably stop impacts from handgun\nand submachinegun threats, but cannot match\nrifle projectiles.
@armor_assaulter_vest_name=Assaulter Vest
@armor_assaulter_vest_desc=<OLD!>Add a pair of Level III Hard Armor plates\nto the vest, protecting the officer's vital\norgans.\n\nWill stop rifle impacts coming from\nthe front and back quarters, while other\ndirections are protected from pistol\ncaliber threats.
@armor_raider_vest_name=Raider Vest
@armor_raider_vest_desc=<OLD!>Minimalistic all-or-nothing Level III plate\ncarrier that trades protection for mobility\nby removing all side armor.\n\nWill stop rifle caliber threats from the\nfront and rear, but leaves the side quarters\ncompletely vulnerable.
@armor_front_plate_only_name=Front Plate Only
@armor_front_plate_only_desc=<OLD!>'I don't know about you, Grimesy, I don't\nplan to get shot in the back, running away'\n\nRemove the Level III plate in the back of\nyour armor to save some weight and regain\nsome mobility.
@armor_extended_protection_name=Extended Protection
@armor_extended_protection_desc=<OLD!>For when you need to pass the gates of fire.\n\nA full featured armor set, covering the\nofficer's vitals, groin, neck and shoulders\nwith Level III and IIIA armor.\n\nWill stop rifle impacts coming from all\ndirections.
@support_gear_spy_camera_name=Spy Camera
@support_gear_spy_camera_desc=An inconspicious camera head that fits under most doors (and, guess what, around corners!), allowing you to see into the unknown.\n\nYour soldiers will automatically turn to check "red ghosts" - the last known positions of bad guys, so intel helps clear rooms faster, safer, and with less collateral.\n\nUse it to recon rooms and danger zones - when you have time to spare.
@support_gear_lockpic_name=Lockpick
@utility_pouch_tazer_name=Tazer
@utility_pouch_tazer_desc=<OLD!>A reloadable less lethal weapon that sends\na pair of electrodes flying into the target\nand electroshocks him into submission.\n\nThe target will become unconscious but the\neffects wear off in 10 seconds, time you\nshould use to handcuff the suspect.\n\nMaximum shooting range: 7m
@utility_pouch_lockpick_machine_name=Lockpick Machine
@utility_pouch_lockpick_machine_desc=CIA Officers are trained to pick locks in almost complete silence, but this takes time - so take this automated pick with you and cut to the chase.\n\nGuaranteed to unlock most doors in 4 seconds or less!
@utility_dynamic_hammer_name=Dynamic Hammer
@utility_dynamic_hammer_desc=\n       "He held up his hammer high\n       And called to Odin for a sign"\n\nYour old Pa might have seemed a bit lame when fistpumping to heroic heavy metal on his commute, but there's something to be said about going into battle wielding a large hammer - even a space age one.\n\nUse it to smash open locked doors in one hit. No, you can't melee people with it.
@utility_bolt_cutter_name=Bolt Cutter
@utility_bolt_cutter_desc=<OLD!>The Bolt Cutter allows you to quickly cut\ndown padlocks and open fence gates.\n\nA must have tool in your inventory once you\nleave downtown and head to the real world.
@utility_breaching_kit_name=Breaching Kit
@utility_breaching_kit_desc=Sure, why not give both the Dynamic Hammer and the Bolt Cutter to the same guy.\n\nYou know which guy, right? We all know him, and he surely deserves it. 
@equipment_protect0=Long Careers
@equipment_protect1=Handguns, SMGs
@equipment_protect2=Handguns, SMGs, Rifles

@disguise_poncho_name=Poncho
@disguise_poncho_desc=Become The Man with No Name, or better, No Guns - by draping a blanket over your shoulders. It's warm and stylish, and it supports the local economy - as maybe you won't need to drop bombs all over the place.\n\nHides your weapons so you can move unseen and adds 5 to Concealment, but once you reveal yourself, you can't go back.

# Pistols
@firearm_tt_33_name=TT-33 (7.62mmP / 8 rds)

@firearm_mps45sup_name=M&P 45C Suppressed

@firearm_g19_name=G19 Pistol
@firearm_g19_desc=The compact G19 was designed to be light and concealable, but still works well as a combat pistol.\n\nIt's fast on the draw and keeps the best bits of its larger brothers: points quickly at the target, shoots fast and controlable; Medium and long range accuracy suffer from trigger and sight radius issues, though. 
@firearm_g19cust_name=G19 Customized
@firearm_g19cust_desc=Take the simple, compact and popular G19, add +5 mag extensions, better sights and trigger, a match barrel with recoil compensator and mill the slide for optics.\n\nIt's a gunfighter's pistol, for sure, with good accuracy, minimal recoil, modern sighting options and no crap that you don't need. 
@firearm_g19x_name=G19X Pistol
@firearm_g19x_desc=An inventory leftover from Army's service pistol trials, this is the original Austrian crossover: a fullsize 9mm frame mated with the slide and barrel of its compact brother.\n\nQuick on the draw and light on the hip, the G19X doesn't sacrifice on magazine capacity and shootability, but the average trigger hinders long range accuracy.
@firearm_g17_name=G17 Pistol
@firearm_g17_desc=The original, trend-setter polymer handgun, still keeping up and winning fights.\n\nThe pistol sits very low in the hand and points naturally, which means it gets fast on the target and stays there as you multi-tap it - provided you can master the heavy factory trigger.
@firearm_g2240_name=G22 Pistol
@firearm_g2240_desc=Somewhere, somehow, some pistol-toting secret squirrel decided that 9mm ammo lacks stopping power but .45 kicks too hard.\n\nThe G22 finds a happy middle-ground in the .40 S&W cartridge - without losing too much in mag capacity. A great close and mid-range pistol, but long range accuracy is a bit wonky. 
@firearm_m17_name=M17 Pistol
@firearm_m17_desc=The Army's newest service pistol, this fullsize nine mil shoots accurately and sports great controls, which make coming up on target, mag reloads and general operation very quick and precise.\n\nIt suffers, however, from a bit of slowness when aiming at long range, due to its fat iron sights.
@firearm_m18_name=M18 Pistol
@firearm_m18_desc=The compact-ish version of the M17, it carries the same amount ammo and shoots about the same, just trades a bit of medium range accuracy for drawing speed and pointing speed.\n\nIf you're only looking for a backup for when the primary goes click instead of bang, this is your huckleberry.
@firearm_m9_name=M9 Pistol
@firearm_m9_desc=One of the original Wonder Nine that pushed 9mm Autos into world dominance, the M9 soldiers on doggedly - and you surely can't go wrong with John McClane's trusty pistol, right?\n\nThe M9 will serve well as backup and close range weapon, and even has the accuracy to pull off decent long range shots.
@firearm_m9sup_name=M9 Suppressed
@firearm_m9sup_desc=Sure, heavy firepower is great, but have you tried silent takedowns with your 7.62 beltfed? A suppressed secondary goes a long way in keeping insertion discrete.\n\nYour M9 can take a can with little work, but the sights are too low so you lose aimed fire.\n\nSound Travel Range: 7m
@firearm_1911_pistol_name=1911 Pistol
@firearm_1911_pistol_desc=Looking for a backup gun than ends fights on the spot? Pull the right strings at regiment level and smuggle in some forgotten crates of Browning's finest.\n\nThe sights may be crap and magazine size is small, but there's nothing like the fat .45 ACP slug to floor Tangos when your life depends on it.
@firearm_1911modern_pistol_desc=This is not your daddy's heirloom nor Army contraband, but a custom 1911 lovingly handfitted by ex-Unit armorers.\n\nThe high level of precision and the great single-action trigger make it a tack-driver - a large and heavy one though. Factor in the fat slugs it slings out at baddies and you kinda keep coming back to it.
@firearm_hk45ct_pistol_name=Mk24 Mod 0 Pistol
@firearm_hk45ct_pistol_desc=The latest .45 the Frogmen adopted but don't carry around, the Mk24 gives you great accuracy and stopping power.\n\nThe high bore-axis makes rapid fire suboptimal, and 1st shot accuracy is hampered by the long Double Action trigger pull. But put a can on it and the gun truly shines, and clears the way for you. 
@firearm_tss4_pistol_name=Mk IV Hush Puppy
@firearm_tss4_pistol_desc=A .22LR target pistol is not much for combat purposes, but properly suppress it and you get a mouse-quiet elimination device.\n\nAgainst unaware targets, at close range, it can be deadly. But move away and it's only useful for varmint and ... <sigh> guard dogs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 2m


@firearm_g17_pistol_1h_name=G17 Pistol (One Hand)
@firearm_g17_pistol_1h_desc=<OLD!>A high capacity 9mm sidearm, the perfect\ncompanion when you know how to hit the\nsoft spots.\n\nLow in the hand and shooting 'just' 9mm, the\nG17 offers great recoil control to deliver\nmultiple shots.
@firearm_p226_pistol_name=P226 Pistol
@firearm_p226_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The P226 is an accurate combat pistol but\nloses some recoil control due to its high\nbore axis.\n\nIn any case, good enough for the Navy SEALs\nshould be good enough for you.
@firearm_p226_pistol_1h_name=P226 Pistol (One Hand)
@firearm_p226_pistol_1h_desc=<OLD!>The P226 is an accurate combat pistol but\nloses some recoil control due to its high\nbore axis.\n\nIn any case, good enough for the Navy SEALs\nshould be good enough for you.
@firearm_mp_40_pistol_name=M&P 40 Pistol
@firearm_mp_40_pistol_desc=<OLD!>A modern semi-automatic in .40 caliber, the\nM&P doesn't recoil as much as a .45 but has\n45 percent chance to stop the threat\non 1st hit.\n\nIn the hands of a skilled shooter it's a\ngreat mix of stopping power, shootability\nand magazine capacity.
@firearm_mp_40_pistol_1h_name=M&P 40 (One Hand)
@firearm_mp_40_pistol_1h_desc=<OLD!>A modern semi-automatic in .40 caliber, the\nM&P doesn't recoil as much as a .45 but has\n45 percent chance to stop the threat on\n1st hit.\n\nIn the hands of a skilled shooter it's a\ngreat mix of stopping power, shootability\nand magazine capacity.
@firearm_686_plus_revolver_name=686 PLUS Revolver
@firearm_686_plus_revolver_desc=<OLD!>Having no moving slide, revolvers offer\nthe distinct advantage of being able to\nmaneuver and shoot in very tight spaces,\nwithout maiming yourself or getting a jam.\n\nHowever, the real reason to get a Magnum\nrevolver is so you can ask some poor soul:\n\n       'Do you feel lucky, punk?'
@firearm_686_plus_revolver_1h_name=686 PLUS (One Hand)
@firearm_686_plus_revolver_1h_desc=<OLD!>Having no moving slide, revolvers offer\nthe distinct advantage of being able to\nmaneuver and shoot in very tight spaces,\nwithout maiming yourself or getting a jam.\n\nThis also applies to using shields, and the\nrevolver can even be shot when literally\ntouching the shield viewport.
@firearm_tazer_1h_name=Tazer (One Hand)
@firearm_tazer_1h_desc=<OLD!>A reloadable less lethal weapon that sends\na pair of electrodes flying into the target\nand electroshocks him into submission.\n\nThe target will become unconscious but the\neffects wear off in 10 seconds, time you\nshould use to handcuff the suspect.\n\nMaximum shooting range: 7m.
@firearm_p226sd_pistol_name=P226-SD Pistol
@firearm_p226sd_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The suppressed version of the P226, loses\nsome practical accuracy as the sights are\nharder to see over the can.\n\nSound Travel Range: 9m
@firearm_vp9_pistol_name=VP-9 Pistol
@firearm_vp9_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The Nec-plus-ultra of 9mm handguns, the\nVP-9 is extremely accurate and reliable.\n\nThe slightly high bore axis has close to\nzero practical effect on recoil and leads\nto very quick follow-up shots.
@firearm_vp9_pistol_1h_name=VP-9 Pistol (One Hand)
@firearm_vp9_pistol_1h_desc=<OLD!>The Nec-plus-ultra of 9mm handguns, the\nVP-9 is extremely accurate and reliable.\n\nThe slightly high bore axis has close to\nzero practical effect on recoil and leads\nto very quick follow-up shots.
@firearm_xd4_ported_pistol_name=XD4 Ported Pistol
@firearm_xd4_ported_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The XD4 Ported tames the powerful .40\ncartridge by venting gas vertically at the\nfront of the barrel.\n\nGreat for recoil-control and getting back\non target but the V-Shaped vertical flash\nwill burn your night vision and your 'stache.\n\nCannot be safely shot in the CAR stance.
@firearm_xd4_ported_pistol_1h_name=XD4 Ported (One Hand)
@firearm_xd4_ported_pistol_1h_desc=<OLD!>The XD4 Ported tames the powerful .40\ncartridge by venting gas vertically at the\nfront of the barrel.\n\nGreat for recoil-control and getting back\non target but the V-Shaped vertical flash\nwill burn your night vision and your 'stache.
@firearm_tactical_357_revolver_name=Tactical .357 Revolver
@firearm_tactical_357_revolver_desc=<OLD!>Designed with the needs of Tactical teams\nin mind, the TR allows troopers to safely\nmaneuver and shoot in tight spaces without\nsacrificing magazine capacity, accuracy or\nrecoil control.
@firearm_tactical_357_revolver_1h_name=Tactical .357 (One Hand)
@firearm_tactical_357_revolver_1h_desc=<OLD!>Designed with the needs of Tactical teams\nin mind, the TR allows troopers to safely\nmaneuver and shoot in tight spaces without\nsacrificing magazine capacity, accuracy or\nrecoil control.\n\nThis also makes it particularly well suited\nfor use with a shield.
@firearm_hk45_pistol_name=HK45 Pistol
@firearm_hk45_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The powerful .45 ACP and all the modern\ndesign features, whats not to like? The HK\nboasts extreme accuracy and high magazine\ncapacity - for a 45 that is.\n\nNot the best pistol for recoil control and\nfollow-up shots, but a solid performer in\nany situation.
@firearm_hk45sd_pistol_name=HK45-SD Pistol
@firearm_hk45sd_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The slow moving .45 slug is the ideal\ncartridge to suppress, and an accurate\npistol doubles its value.\n\nA great conversation starter if there ever\nwas one.\n\nSound Travel Range: 6m
@firearm_revolver_38_special_name=Revolver (.38 Special)
@firearm_fs_ap_pistol_name=FS AP Pistol
@firearm_fs_ap_pistol_desc=<OLD!>A handgun shooting the same armor piercing\nrounds as the P90 PDW, the FS will easily\ndefeat level IIIA body armor and shields.\n\nThe low bullet mass makes for controllable,\ntarget-pistol-like recoil but does not\nfavorize stopping power. Factor in the flat\nlong range trajectory and you might have a\ngreat specialist item.
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_name=Magnum 44 Revolver
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_desc=<OLD!>There's not much you can carry on duty more\npowerful than this Magnum 44 - at least if\nyou intend to keep your badge.\n\nSized right for quick shots at close range,\nthe 44 is powerful enough to quickly end\nfights and make a mess of the coroner's\nwork, but will leave you exposed when\nlonger shots are needed.
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_1h_name=Magnum 44 (One Hand)
@firearm_magnum_44_revolver_1h_desc=<OLD!>There's not much you can carry on duty more\npowerful than this Magnum 44 - at least if\nyou intend to keep your badge.\n\nSized right for quick shots at close range,\nthe 44 is powerful enough to quickly end\nfights and make a mess of the coroner's\nwork, but will leave you exposed when\nlonger shots are needed.
@firearm_mark_23_pistol_name=Mark 23 Pistol
@firearm_mark_23_pistol_desc=<OLD!>The great .45 pistol of the late 90s, the\nMark 23 is extremely accurate, powerful\nand just too damn big.\n\nMore of a collectors item than a practical\nhandgun - unless your job description\nincludes crawling through hell and knocking\nheads at 50 yards, that is.
@firearm_mark_23sd_pistol_name=Mark 23-SD Pistol
@firearm_mark_23sd_pistol_desc=<OLD!>With its elevated sights and slow moving\nslugs, the Mark 23 is uniquely suited for\nthe role of silent sentry remover.\n\nSuperb accuracy makes for a first shot that\nalways counts and the weight actually helps\nwith controlling recoil for followup shots.\n\nSound Travel Range: 6m
@firearm_sp01_shadow_pistol_name=SP01 Shadow Pistol
@firearm_sp01_shadow_pistol_desc=<OLD!>A target-grade 9mm with the mag capacity\nfor those that just don't care for reloading,\nthe Shadow was built with the needs of Tac\nTeams and race shooters alike in mind:\n\nSpeed, Accuracy and Rate of Fire limited\nby shooter skill and training only.
@firearm_veterinary_pistol_name=Veterinary Pistol
@firearm_veterinary_pistol_desc=<OLD!>Built to humanely dispatch wounded animals\nbut bearing obvious World War 2 lineage, the\nVP is also a great 2-legged Pest Remover.\n\nThe ported barrel and bolt action operation\neliminate all practical sound report, along\nwith any dream of rapid fire.\n\nSound Travel Range: 1.5m

# Rifles
@firearm_mk18_name=Mk18 Carbine
@firearm_mkl8_desc=The shorty Mk18 started out as a Navy SEALs custom carbine for pure CQB and vehicle work, but it quickly found its way into the lockers of cool Army teams.\n\nHandles doorways and short rooms very well, but the low muzzle velocity means it will not reliably drop targets past 15m. 
@firearm_m249spw_name=M249 SPW
@firearm_m249spw_desc=Rangers depend on their machineguns to provide overwhelming fire support while the squad maneuvers.\n\nThe M249 SPW is particularly engineered light enough to handle even room clearing ops, but will also work better when firing from a cover position. 
@firearm_m240l_name=M240L GPMG
@firearm_m240l_desc=The large and heavy M240 shines when sustained firepower is needed and its heavy ammo will take down bad guys reliably.\n\nJust don't expect to sprint around and hip-fire this baby - it really needs to be stabilized on a cover point to be effective. 
@firearm_mg338_name=XM338 LMMG
@firearm_mg338_desc=A light-ish Medium Machine Gun that can score effective hits on the enemy at extreme ranges, the XMG338 comes in use where a fifty-cal MG would be needed.\n\nThe Magnum ammo kicks heavily and the ammo weights a lot, so this baby shoots short bursts only.
@firearm_m14ebr_name=M14 EBR
@firearm_m14ebr_desc=The venerable M14 of Vietnam era lives on as a Marksman rifle, and keeps its deadly reputation.\n\nHighly customizable via its adjustable stock, the rifle delivers 7.62mm holes in all the right places once the shooter is comfy in a stationary cover position.
@firearm_m110a1_name=M110A1 SDMR
@firearm_m110a1_desc=The German answer to the semi-auto sniper problem, the M110A1 is plenty accurate but doesn't forget its assault rifle heritage.\n\nWill handle everything from sniping to room clearing, though the weight and length say you shouldn't make this your go-to Close Quarters gun. 
@firearm_m16a4_name=M16A4 Rifle
@firearm_m16a4_desc=The Vietnam-era "Mattel Gun" - now in the modernized, all-railed version for the 21st century warfighter.\n\nAccurate and deadly at all ranges, but ill-suited for CQB work - as the barrel tends to bump into doorframes and fellow Rangers.\n\nJust don't give it to your pointman. 
@firearm_m16a4dmr_name=Squad DM Rifle
@firearm_m16a4dmr_desc=The SDM-R is totally not your buddy's M16, but its high accuracy cousin. It's got match trigger, fluted free floating barrel, a bipod and - most importantly - better stats from the game developers.\n\nIt won't shoot as fast and as often as vanilla M16s, but has better Kill Probabilty, and less recoil than the 7.62mm rifles. 
@firearm_mk48_name=Mk48 Mod 1 LMG
@firearm_mk48_desc=What do you get when you scale up the old reliable M249 SAW? A portable 7.62mm Light MachineGun for your squad!\n\nLight is not always good - more weight helps to control recoil, so better place it in a cover position to stabilize it on its bipod and get those long bursts on target.
@firearm_mk20ssr_name=Mk20 SSR
@firearm_mk20ssr_desc=What the Mk17 LB can't, the Mk20 will do.\n\nThe proper Marksman member of the Mk16/17 family, the Sniper Support Rifle will give you all the accuracy you'd need from it, as long as you don't forget to properly deploy it as support, not frontline troop. 
@firearm_mk17_cqc_name=Mk17 CQC
@firearm_mk17_cqc_desc=The Close Quarters Combat version of the Mk17 sports a shortie barrel, but can't shed much of the weight needed to handle the powerful 7.62x51 cartridge.\n\nStill, in close quarters, there's sometimes no room for second thoughts - or second shots. And they are rarely needed. 
@firearm_mk17_std_name=Mk17 Carbine
@firearm_mk17_std_desc=Out with the old, in with the new, right? The Mk17 mates M16-ish controls with reliable internals and battle-rifle grade ammo.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nThe heavier recoil? The reduced mag capacity? The increased weight?
@firearm_mk17_lb_name=Mk17 Long Barrel
@firearm_mk17_lb_desc=The LB version of the Mk17 is not a pure Designated Marksman Rifle, but can mimic one well enough to fool insurgents and Sergeants Major alike.\n\nThe 7.62 ammo hits them hard and puts them down, while AR-like controls and size give this enough maneuverability to handle a bit of room clearing too.
@firearm_m4_m203_desc=Take your dependable workhorse - the good for all M4 - and hang a freakin' handcannon underneath its barrel.\n\nYou do lose some maneuverability and aiming speed, but gain the ability to insta-blast some poor guy hiding in cover, and splash his friends too as a bonus.
@firearm_mk18_m203_desc=The Mk18 is light and handy enough to take the extra weight of the M203 and still keep a bit of close quarters aiming performance.\n\nWhen the range opens up though, 40mm frags are a hard to beat argument and supplement the poor performance of 556 ammo out this short barrel. 
@firearm_m16_m203_desc=Two long and heavy barrels are better than one, the Sarge said, and who needs to sprint anyway?\n\nDominate the battlefield with precise medium range fire from your 556 for single targets and all-encompassing 40mm grenades for larger parties.  
@firearm_AT4_name=M136 AT4 Launcher
@firearm_AT4_desc=A one-shot, disposable rocket launcher that can blow up anything from groups of baddies to doors and wall sections.\n\nNot the greatest tool when collateral damage is to be minimized, and takes a while to setup and fire.\n\nBut if the devs ever actually add functional enemy vehicles, you've got this bad boy ready for them!\n\nDeploy time: 4 seconds\nLethal Blast Range: 3m
@firearm_MK14_name=MK14 Mod 0 GL
@firearm_MK14enemy_name=MK14 GL (40mm / 6 rds)
@firearm_MK14_desc=no desc yet, wip weapon


# SMGs
@firearm_mp5k_name=Mp5K 
@firearm_mp5k_desc=Cut or remove everything from the MP5 and you get the Kurz, the Clandestine Ops specialist.\n\nAs easy to hide as a pistol, the K offers good accuracy at short range, but the complete lack of stock makes it lose on recoil control during rapid and automatic fire. 
@firearm_mp5kpdw_name=Mp5K PDW
@firearm_mp5kpdw_desc=The short, folding stock variant of the Mp5 has everything cut down for concealment, which also makes it very handy for CQB.\n\nOnce you get it into battle, it still puts holes right in the bad guys A-Zone, just not from so far away, and not if they're wearing soft armor vests.
@firearm_mp5a_name=Mp5A5 SMG
@firearm_mp5a_desc=The quintessential Counter-Terrorist weapon of the 80s, the Mp5 has now lost its throne to carbines and modern PDWs with better medium range ballistics.\n\nShort, very fast and accurate at CQB ranges, the Mp5 is a superb tool for delicate Hostage Rescue work, but reloads are oh so-last century - and slow! 
@firearm_mp5sd_name=Mp5SD6 SMG
@firearm_mp5sd_desc=Take the very accurate Mp5 and drop muzzle velocity to subsonic by porting the barrel, add a suppressor - what do you get?\n\nA death machine so quiet you can hear the bullet impact, and a tool to save lives when being detected gets people killed.\n\nSound Travel Range: 2.5m
@firearm_mp7_name=Mp7A1 PDW
@firearm_mp7_desc=The Mp7 is short and concealable and shoots a tiny rifle-like bullet, which means recoil is minimal and it can group quick and accurate bursts even at medium range.\n\nDepending on the ammo used this gun handles Soft Armor targets quite well, but per-shot Stopping Power and Kill Probability are a bit lacking.


# Shotguns
@firearm_m500pp_name=M500-MEK Shotgun
@firearm_m500pp_desc=!!!Placeholder text, the weapon is not yet fully in the game
@firearm_m1014_name=M1014 Shotgun
@firearm_m1014_desc=Combat shotguns are not regular Rangers weaponry these days, but there are some left in the Armory.\n\nThe M1014 is a reliable semi-auto death machine when firing buckshot, but won't cycle properly with breaching rounds and is too long for room clearing operations. 
@firearm_breacher_name=Breacher Shotgun
@firearm_breacher_desc=A short and handy pistol-gripped shottie, loaded exclusively with breaching rounds.\n\nThese are specially designed to maximize effect on the locks while minimizing chances of ricochets and collateral damage.\n\nNo bad guy tapping with this one, sadly.

@firearm_pm63_name=PM-63 (9mm / 25 rds)
@firearm_pm63cia_name=PM-63 RAK PDW
@firearm_pm63cia_desc=An old Personal Defense Weapon for Warsaw Pact crews and drivers, the PM-63 is readily available on the black market and looks mostly like an ordinary pistol.\n\nThe gun is strictly a close range tool as accuracy is bad and the sights recoil with the slide as you shoot, but for pocketable full auto mayhem, its rather unique. 
@firearm_miniuzi_name=Mini Uzi (9mm / 32 rds)
@firearm_miniuzicia_name=Mini Uzi SMG
@firearm_miniuzicia_desc=Popular with types that need both discretion and automatic firepower, the Mini Uzi is a bit outdated now in its heavy, all-steel construction and the open-bolt design limits single shot accuracy.\n\nIt shines in CQB work though, as the weight balances on top of the user's hand, reloads are fast and full-auto is very manageable.     
@firearm_type56_name=AK-47S (7.62mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_akm_name=AK-47 (7.62mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_type56cia_name=AK-47 Underfolder
@firearm_type56cia_desc=The underfolding stock version of the AK47 is easier to conceal, but its accuracy potential is hampered by the poor cheekweld.\n\nThe stock prevents the mounting of optics, but for surprise close range automatic firepower, this one is hard to beat.
@firearm_akmcia_name=AKM Rifle
@firearm_akmcia_desc=The standard insurgent combat rifle all around the world, it keeps working no matter what you do to it.\n\nIt's not particulary accurate nor fast at long range and reloads are relatively slow, but it does the most important thing - looks like it belongs in the busy streets of Nowheraki.
@firearm_aks74u_name=AKS-74U (5.45mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_aks74ucia_name=AKS-74U Carbine
@firearm_aks74ucia_desc=Designed as a PDW for too-cool Soviet forces and used as status symbol all through the Middle East, the AKSU is a handy little beast of an Assault Rifle.\n\nIt's balanced perfectly for close range and CQB work, but the short barrel and sight radius sacrifice long range accuracy and stopping power.  
@firearm_ak105alpha_name=AK-105 Alpha (5.45mm / 30 rds)
@firearm_ak105alphacia_desc=Styled after the latest trends of RusSOF operators but upgraded in the good old USA, the Alpha keeps the AK internals and adds a collapsible stock and full rails to mount your capitalist optics.\n\nThe gun will anger purists and is heavy for a mid-length AK but shoots straight and provides deadly mid-range rapid fire.
@firearm_ak105alphacia_name=AK-105 Alpha
@firearm_sr3m_name=SR3-M (9mm AP / 20 rds)
@firearm_fal_name=FAL (7.62mm / 20 rds)
@firearm_RPG7_name=RPG-7 (93mm HEAT)
@firearm_RPG26_name=RPG-26 (72.5mm HEAT)
@firearm_RPG26cia_name=RPG-26 Launcher
@firearm_RPG26cia_desc=The one-shot RPG26 is lighter, smaller and less conspicious than your AT4 option, but also shoots a smaller and slower warhead.\n\nShould still do a good job as hole puncher in walls, doors and any unlucky enemy.\n\nAnd it does fit nicely with your local garb outfit.\n\nDeploy time: 3 seconds\nLethal Blast Range: 2m
@firearm_SVD_name=SVD-63 (7.62mmR / 10 rds)
@firearm_SVDcia_name=SVD-63 Dragunov
@firearm_SVDcia_desc=The Russian Army marksman rifle is not uncommon in these streets, so it should raise less eyebrows when you play local.\n\nIt's long, heavy but not unwieldy, and just accurate enough to score good hits at practical ranges - but the bullets hit hard and pierce through level III armor.  
@firearm_VSS_name=VSS (9mm AP Silent / 10 rds)
@firearm_VSScia_name=VSS Vintorez
@firearm_VSScia_desc=Built by the Soviets for clandestine ops, the VSS uses very heavy subsonic rifle ammo and an integral suppressor to provide silent marksman fire at medium range.\n\nAnd if there's unexpected trouble, it can rock-n-roll on Full Auto, too!\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m

@firearm_evo_3_smg_name=Evo 3 SMG
@firearm_evo_3_smg_desc=<OLD!>Europeans love their SMGs and the rapid-\nfiring, compact Evo 3 is a great example.\n\nFast on the target and quick to fill it with\n9mm holes, it mixes European and American-\nstyle controls intelligently and can be\nrun and reloaded very efficiently.\n\nOverall one hell of a bang for your buck.
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_name=Bren A1 Assault Rifle
@firearm_bren_a1_assault_rifle_desc=<OLD!>A newcomer polymer assault rifle from\nCentral Europe, the Bren will do the job\nbut not break the bank.\n\nBetter than average long range accuracy is\nowed to the modular stock, but controls and\noverall layout make the Bren relatively\nslow in practical operation.
@firearm_ump45_smg_name=UMP45 SMG
@firearm_ump45_smg_desc=<OLD!>The UMP fires the reliable .45 ACP and does\nit with German accuracy, providing the\nhighest stopping power you can get in a\nSMG package.\n\nA bit large and unwieldy for most users,\nand the heavy recoil affects follow-up\nshots speed and accuracy.
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_name=Mp5A3-SD SMG
@firearm_mp5a3_sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Mounting a 7 inch suppressor on your Mp5A3\nmight not be the best way to maintain CQB\nmaneuverability, but will lower shot sound\nlevels by a decent number of decibels.\n\nThe weapon loses some accuracy but in\npractical terms effects are negligible.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_name=UMP45-SD SMG
@firearm_ump45_sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Mounting a suppressor on the UMP45 is\nstraightforward and efficient, as long as\nyou accept handling a 16 inch barrel SMG.\n\nVery deadly at close range and against bad\nguys not wearing armor.\n\nSound Travel Range: 5m
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_name=MP7-SD SMG
@firearm_mp7sd_smg_desc=<OLD!>The small and maneuverable Mp7 shoots tiny\nbullets, but the low recoil and flat, rifle-\nlike trajectory translate into quick and\naccurate bursts of fire even at long range.\n\nThose tiny bullets do punch through kevlar\nwith ease, even when suppressed.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m

@firearm_m16a4_m203_name=M16/M203 GL
@firearm_m4_carabine_desc=Taking over front line duty from the larger M16, the M4 trades some muzzle velocity and accuracy to gain maneuverability.\n\nIts 14.5" barrel will suffer a drop in lethality past 30m, but can benefit from switching out the default ammo.\n\nAn all-around capable workhorse. 
@firearm_m4_cqbr_name=M4 CQB-R (Auto / 5.56mm)
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_name=MPX .40 SMG
@firearm_mpx_40_smg_desc=<OLD!>A modern submachinegun with AR15-style\ncontrols, the MPX is fast in operation and\nvery maneuverable in close spaces.\n\nHigh Rate of Fire coupled with decent\nstopping power make this a reliable fight\nstopper until the bad guys start donning\nbody armor.
@firearm_p90_pdw_name=P90 PDW
@firearm_p90_pdw_desc=<OLD!>A compact Personal Defense Weapon shooting\na high velocity intermediate round, the P90\nis great for Close Quarters Combat and will\npierce straight through level IIIA armor.\n\nThe flat trajectory of the 5.7mm is great\nfor mid-to-long range shots, but stopping\npower potential is less than that of SMGs\nshooting traditional calibers.
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_name=G36C Assault Rifle
@firearm_g36c_assault_rifle_desc=<OLD!>A favorite of European SWAT teams, the G36C\nis short, light and very maneuverable.\n\nThe short barrel comes at the expense of\nstopping power though, as the low muzzle\nvelocity cuts under the reliable frag-\nmentation threshold for 5.56 rounds.
@firearm_mk16_pdw_name=Mk 16 PDW
@firearm_mk16_pdw_desc=<OLD!>This ultra compact PDW is handy in close\nquarters or when concealment is needed.\n\nIts small size makes it quick to get into\naction but the skeleton stock is a poor\nshooting platform, so accuracy and recoil\ncontrol are sub-standard.\n\nNot recommended for hostage rescue work.
@firearm_hk416d10_name=HK416D10 Carbine
@firearm_hk416d10_desc=<OLD!>The German engineering take on the AR15,\nthe HK416 is a favorite of Tier 1 Special\nOperation Groups and armchair commandos\nworldwide.\n\nVery reliable and accurate, in the 10 inch\nbarrel version it's also maneuverable but\na little slow on the target due to the heavy\nrail.
@firearm_commando_553_name=Commando 553
@firearm_commando_553_desc=<OLD!>Another European carbine built to very\nhigh standards, the 553 is accurate and\nmaneuverable, but falls behind on stopping\npower due to the short barrel.\n\nGood balance makes it easy to reload and\nrecover from dropping the barrel in a tight\nspot.
@firearm_vector_smg_name=Vector SMG
@firearm_vector_smg_desc=<OLD!>The avant-garde Vector SMG masters the\npowerful .45 rounds by clever positioning\nof shooter hands and directing the bolt to\nrecoil downards.\n\nResulting recoil is very mild and allows\nimpressive 2 round bursts grouping, but the\nshort barrel makes for less spectacular\nfirst round accuracy.
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_name=SAR-18 Bullpup
@firearm_sar18_bullpup_desc=<OLD!>With an 18 inch barrel and an overall length\nof 27.5, the SAR is a great mix of accuracy,\nstopping power and maneuverabilty.\n\nThe placement of the magazine well to the\nrear slows down reloads considerably,\nthough, and weight is a bit on the high side.
@firearm_ak47_rifle_name=AK-47 Rifle (Semi / 7.62mm)

@firearm_sniper_rifle_name=SniperRifle
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_name=P90-SD PDW
@firearm_p90sd_pdw_desc=<OLD!>The P90 is a great submachinegun for most\nurban engagements, but suppressing it does\nnot cover the supersonic crack of its high\nvelocity rounds.\n\nUsing subsonic ammo would negate the issue,\nbut would also lose most platform traits.\n\nSound Travel Range: 10m
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_name=MPX-SD .40 SMG
@firearm_mpxsd_40_smg_desc=<OLD!>The integrally suppressed version of the\nMPX is a joy to operate in combat thanks to \nthe AR-15 style controls.\n\nSubsonic .40 rounds don't pack that much of\na punch, but with the right training will\nmake short work of bad guy groups.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3m
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_name=Vector-SD SMG
@firearm_vectorsd_smg_desc=<OLD!>Suppressing .45 SMGs is a no-brainer and\nthe Vector's can has excellent signature\nreduction and zero effect on accuracy.\n\nYou'll appreciate the deadly bursts on\ntargets at close to medium range, but watch\nout for armored bad guys.\n\nSound Travel Range: 4m

@firearm_hk416d10sd_carabine_desc=<OLD!>Attaching a suppressor to a Short Barrel\nRifle is not optimal but does reduce the\nsound signature a little bit while keeping\nthe long range accuracy and lethality.\n\nYou best keep the increased barrel length\nin mind when navigating interior spaces.\n\nSound Travel Range: 13m
@firearm_honey_badger_name=Honey Badger
@firearm_honey_badger_desc=<OLD!>A great mix of ballistic performance, small\nsize and excellent sound suppression, the\nHoney Badger might gain a permanent spot in\nthe hands of Tier 1 Special Forces.\n\nArmor penetration is not great though, only\nmarginally better than pistol-caliber SMGs.\n\nSound Travel Range: 3.5m
